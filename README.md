# MPC-Inspired Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Model-Free Control

Code for the paper: [MPC-Inspired Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Model-Free Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.05332)

## Installation

The code is tested on Linux with Python 3.10, PyTorch 2.1.0, and CUDA 12.0. It is recommended to use a conda environment for installation:

```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n learning-qp python=3.10
conda activate learning-qp

# Clone repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yiwenlu66/learning-qp.git
cd learning-qp

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

Note: the `--recursive` option is necessary to make the code work correctly.

## Usage

```
python run.py train_or_test env_name [--options]
```

The following scripts are also provided to reproduce the results in the paper:

- `experiments/tank/reproduce.sh` for reproducing the first part of Table 1
- `experiments/cartpole/reproduce.sh` for reproducing the second part of Table 1
- `experiments/tank/reproduce_disturbed.sh` for reproducing Table 2

**These scripts are run on GPU by default.** After running each reproducing script, the following data will be saved:

- Training logs in tensorboard format will be saved in `runs`
- Test results, including the trial output for each experiment and a summary table, all in CSV format, will be saved in `test_results`

## Code structure

- `rl_games`: A customized version of the [rl_games](https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games) library for RL training
- `src/envs`: GPU parallelized simulation environments, with interface similar to [Isaac Gym](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/IsaacGymEnvs)
- `src/modules`: PyTorch modules, including the proposed QP-based policy and the underlying differentiable QP solver
- `src/networks`: Wrapper around the QP-based policy for interfacing with `rl_games`
- `src/utils`: Utility functions (customized PyTorch operations, MPC baselines, etc.)
- `experiments`: Sample scripts for running experiments
